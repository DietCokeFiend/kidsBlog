						<p>Be sure that the area your kiddy is playing is safe and appropriate for the child's age. If your child is too small do not let him on an older child's playground because little ones do not have the skills and strength to manage situations by themselves.</p>

						<p>Young children skin is particularly delicate and sensitive; too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can burn the kiddie's skin a lot faster. Using sun-protecting cream, light clothes with long-sleeved and a hat will help. It's a good idea to avoid being in direct sun during 10am and 3pm, when the sun's rays are most intense.</p>

						<p>Make sure to keep adult supervision when little ones are around water. Avoid letting recipients with water around little ones and keep those upside down if you are not using them so they can't fill up with water. If you have a swimming pool at home check often that the pool fence is in good condition and it's complies with safety standards.</p>
