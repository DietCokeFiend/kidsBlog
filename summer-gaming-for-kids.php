		<h6><a href="http://games.disney.com" title="Go to Disney Games Home Page">by Disney Games</a></h6>

		<p>This is a game developed and published by Disney.  The premise is quite simple.  Mr. Aligator needs his water to take a shower or bath.  It is your goal to clear the path so that water can get to Mr. Aligator's water pipes.  I've seen kids play with this and it's hours upon hours of clicking and tapping fun on any of the prominent mobile devices.</p>
