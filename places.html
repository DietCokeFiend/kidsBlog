        <h1>CN Tower</h1>
		<p>

A Wonder of the Modern World, the CN Tower is Canada’s most celebrated architectural triumph with Toronto’s most spectacular views – day or night. This Toronto must-see is a world-class entertainment and dining destination. Explore two observation levels up to 1,136 ft/346m, the world famous Glass Floor at 1,122 ft./342m with outdoor SkyTerrace, and access to attractions such as the CN Tower story in the Height of Excellence film, motion theatre ride and more.
</p>
		
		<p>The CN Tower is a 553.33 m-high (1,815.4 ft) concrete communications and observation tower in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was completed in 1976,
		becoming the world's tallest free-standing structure and world's tallest tower at the time. It held both records for 34 years until the completion of Burj Khalifa and Canton Tower in 2010.
		It remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, a signature icon of Toronto's skyline, and a symbol of Canada,[7][8] attracting more than two million international visitors annually.
 
Its name "CN" originally referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets, prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for real estate development. Since the name CN Tower became common in daily usage, the abbreviation was eventually expanded to Canadian National Tower or Canada's National Tower. However, neither of these names is commonly used.[10]
 
In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers, where it holds second-place ranking.[11

	 <h1>Marine Land</h1>
	 
You can see that in the eyes of the caregivers here and in the eager applications of those who dream of working here. We employ two of the best-trained veterinarians in Canada to give constant medical attention to all of our animals, especially the older ones who have retired from our shows and are living out their late years in our retirement home. We also consult with one of the top marine mammal veterinarians in the world. We're planning on a wonderful season starting in May. 
Some of our belugas are pregnant and they'll be giving birth soon and watching the babies swim with their moms is a breathtaking experience.

   <h1>African Lion Safari</h1>
   
   <p>African Lion Safari, just an hour outside of Toronto, holds all the wonders of Africa. With doors locked and windows up, a one-hour drive through the reserve takes families past grazing giraffes, exotic birds and majestic lions. You can also leave your car parked and take a guided bus tour through the safari for an additional fee.
 
In 2011, the Safari welcomed its 40th cheetah cub, making it one of the top cheetah breeding programs in Canada. There are also successful breeding programs for endangered birds, Asian elephants, giraffes and rhinoceroses.
 
Check out live animal performances including the Parrot Paradise Show, Birds of Prey Flying Demonstration and Elephant Round-Up, or watch the Elephant Swim in the recreational lake. African Lion Safari also provides picnic areas, the “African Queen” boat tour, the “Nature Boy” railway, and Misumu Bay water play area for the kids.
